The aim of this work is to clarify the possibility to analyze real life datas and simulate the pedestrian crowd.
To do so it's necessary to be able to collect datas from a real world situation with enough precision and high acquisition ratio.
Once datas are collected properly is then possible to \emph{learn} how the behave.

The dynamics of a pedestrian is a complex motion in which multiple conditions and forces play a role.
The motion of a single pedestrian in a crowd is a similarly complex problem.
Despite everywhere in the world it is possible to find and watch walking pedestrian, it is however not as simple to acquire data about their motion.
So the first problematic issue is the data acquisition.
A possible, and first, solution to this is the video recording at a given spot.
However this choice lead to others problem such us privacy violation and the object tracking from the video.
Still the first issue doesn't have a real solution except if faces are blurred.
During the lasts decades the development of machine learning and imaging recognition has provided more tools to analyze this type of data.
So that is now possible to elaborate the image of a video surveillance system and obtain analytic datas.
Other recent technological advancements have also enabled real-life high-accuracy measurements of pedestrian trajectory.
The data are acquired through the usage of overhead depth-sensing cameras.
This second approach allows a large scale anonymous acquisition of pedestrian trajectories without compromising quality or privacy.
In this research a statistical approach is used to assimilate the average paths of pedestrians trajectories.
Based on this, four models are being studied to evaluate which one is better predicting the most probable path.
The assumption is that a crowd produces an \emph{effective potential}. 
Due to the statistical approach this potential is also a probabilistic model, that make, or not, possible a good prediction based on probabilities.
The \emph{probability} is inducted by the real-data observation.
The path of synthetic pedestrian is given by a Monte Carlo simulation that defines the probability to move in every direction given a position.
To make this study possible the space and time discretization is essential.



\section{Challenges}

\paragraph{Starting from real data how can we define a good model to simulate a pedestrian in the crowd flow?}
In this type of system there is a multitude of \emph{forces} that determinate the path of a single pedestrian.
So let's take into account a single pedestrian $P$ that walks in a certain space.
The first type of interaction is the structure where $P$ can or cannot walk thought, that is defined as the whole domain $\Omega$.
The second interaction is between $P$ and the other pedestrians.
Every pedestrian needs a personal space all around, that is variable due the circumstance and it is not easy to be analytically determinate.
A third type of interaction are random events along the $P$'s path, real world events.
...

\paragraph{How to visualise the pedestrian's path using a multi-dimensional histogram?}
It is possible to plot every single trajectory, but this lead to a chaotic data representation and not so functional nor readable.
It is also easily possible to plot the \emph{heatmap} of a dataset to analyse the most "walked" areas.
Even if this second plot choice can takes into account more trajectories than the first and still be readable, it has a problem.
This second lead to a representation where the time dependency is completely lost.
