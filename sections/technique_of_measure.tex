The recording technique selected to make this work possible, it is the Xovis sensor. 
The entire field of view is covered using multiple cameras working together. 
Starting from the raw images, each object is tracked down along its entire path. 
This is possible by using imaging recognition software. 
The software gives as an output a data collection with coordinates and time for each pedestrian.

The sensor is designed by \emph{Xovis company}, and it is composed of two cameras able to generate a stereo view. 
The Xovis 3D sensors master every people counting and people flow measurement challenge with high precision. 
This technology enables people counting and tracking in real-time. 
A minimal design and embedded processing are some of the main characteristics which build the base of the Xovis sensors. 
Further, AI-based algorithms improve the accuracy and flexibility of people counting and people flow management. 
The signature 3D stereo vision technology permits accurate people counting of up to 99.9\%. 
Over a decade, these sensors have been field-tested and proven to stay true to Swiss precision. 
The Xovis 3D stereo vision sensor with a powerful on-sensor person tracking engine always guarantees data privacy. 
Data is only transmitted in text format and without any kind of personally identifiable information. 
The sensors can be configured to be GDPR compliant. 
Sensors can work together as one, easily covering large areas and tracking visitor paths.
