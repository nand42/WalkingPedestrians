The recording techniques employed are two: Kinect based technology and ProRail security cameras.
In both cases the field of view is covered using multiple cameras working together.
Starting from the row images, each object is tracked down along its entire path.
This is possible using imaging recognition software.
The software give as output a data-frame with coordinates and time for each pedestrian.
